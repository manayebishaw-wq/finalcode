        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hey there! Welcome to my corner of the web. When I'm not diving into
          the world of website development, you can usually find me fueling up
          on the essentials: a good cup of tea, a slice of pizza, or a juicy
          burger. <br /><br />
          Right now, I love bringing ideas to life through code. I'm building my
          skills daily and have my sights set on becoming a full-stack developer
          within the next two years. I'm passionate about learning everything
          that makes a modern application tick — from the front-end user
          experience to the back-end logic.

          I am a dedicated and aspiring website developer with a strong passion
          for coding. My current focus is on building robust and user-friendly
          web solutions, fueled by a relentless drive for learning and
          improvement. <br /><br />
          My clear goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer within
          the next two years, tackling both client-side and server-side
          challenges.

          I'm a passionate web developer always ready for a new challenge. I
          love crafting digital experiences, with my favorite coding companions
          being tea, pizza, and burgers. <br /><br />
          My clear ambition? To master both the front-end and back-end and
          become a complete full-stack developer within the next 24 months.
          Let's build something great!
